# shadow-taxi-game
Hectic taxi simulation game in Java created while learning object-oriented programming

<h2>Game Overview:</h2>
You are a taxi driver stuck on an endless road, attempting to survive in this current economic
crisis. Move the driver to control a taxi in the lanes, pick up passengers and drop off the passen-
gers at their trip end flags to earn money. Each passenger has a priority, which can increase the
driver’s earnings. Collect the coins, to increase the passenger’s priority. If you stop past the trip
end flag, you lose money! To make things harder, there are enemy cars and other cars, who will
collide and cause damage to the driver, passenger and the taxi. If the driver or a passenger’s health
decreases to below 0, you lose! Can you beat the target score before the time elapses to complete the
game?

<h2>Implementation Details:</h2>
This game was made using Java and the Basic Aademic Game Engine Library (BAGEL) developed at UniMelb.
The code for this project is not entirely mine; it is based on the skeleton code made by the teaching
staff which had the basic implementations of the first part of the project (movement of taxi, simple
win/loss mechanics and opening and end screens for the game)

<h2>Demo:</h2>
These win/loss demo videos were produced by UniMelb’s 2024 Sem 2 SWEN20003 teaching team
